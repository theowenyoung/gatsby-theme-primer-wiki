As a classic example, if you wanted to predict housing prices, you could build a data set that maps features about houses (square feet, location, proximity to Caltrain, etc) onto their actual price, and then train a network to recognize the complex relationship between features and pricing. Training happens by feeding the network features, letting it make a guess about the price, and then correcting the guess (backpropagation).\n  - Convolutional Neural Networks work similarly, but with images. Instead of giving a CNN discrete features, you'll usually just use the pixels of the image itself. Through a series of layers, the CNN is able to build features itself (traditionally things like edges, corners) and learn patterns in image data. For example, a CNN might be trained on a dataset that maps images onto labels, and learn how to label new images on its own.\n\n## Links\n\n- [But what is a Neural Network? | Deep learning, chapter 1 (2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)\n- [A Neural Network Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org)\n- [A Beginner's Guide To Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/)\n- [Capsule Networks (CapsNets) – Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPN8d0E3900)\n- [Chris Olah explains neural nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdqu6fvjc5c)\n- [How I Shipped a Neural Network on iOS with CoreML, PyTorch, and React Native](https://attardi.org/pytorch-and-coreml) - Detailed and awesome article.\n- [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in 50 lines of code (PyTorch)](https://medium.com/@devnag/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-in-50-lines-of-code-pytorch-e81b79659e3f)\n- [Neural Networks, Types, and Functional Programming](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/)\n- [Recurrent Neural Networks lecture by Yoshua Bengio](http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2016_bengio_neural_networks/)\n- [Practical Advice for Building Deep Neural Networks](https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/2017/10/02/practical-advice-for-building-deep-neural-networks/)\n- [Differentiable Architecture Search](https://github.com/quark0/darts) - Code for [DARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09055) paper.\n- [TensorSpace.js](https://github.com/tensorspace-team/tensorspace) - Neural network 3D visualization framework, build interactive and intuitive model in browsers, support pre-trained deep learning models from TensorFlow, Keras, TensorFlow.js\n- [UIS-RNN](https://github.com/google/uis-rnn) - Library for the Unbounded Interleaved-State Recurrent Neural Network (UIS-RNN) algorithm, corresponding to the paper Fully Supervised Speaker Diarization.\n- [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) - Open Neural Network Exchange.
