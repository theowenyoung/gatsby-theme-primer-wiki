Download the [GistPad extension](https://aka.ms/gistpad) and then re-start Visual Studio Code\n\n1. Run the `GistPad: Sign In` command and then complete the authentication flow using your GitHub account\n\n1. Run the `GistPad: Open Repository` command and select the `Create repo from template...` or `Create private repo from template...` depending on your preference\n\n1. Select the `Foam-style wiki` template, and then specify a name for your Foam workspace (e.g. `my-foam-notes`, `johns-knowledge-base`)\n\nYour new repo will be created in your GitHub account, and the `Foam` welcome page will be automatically opened. If you already have an existing Foam workspace in GitHub, then when you run step #3 above, simply select or specify the name of the GitHub repository instead.\n\n> Note: If you have any and all feedback on how GistPad can be improved to support your Foam workflow, please don't hesitate to [let us know](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad)! 👍\n\n<img width=\"700px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/87863222-c1b76180-c90d-11ea-87d9-04bee1c58a0d.png\" />\n\n## Managing your workspace\n\nOnce you've opened/created the Foam repository, it will appear in the `Repositories` view of the `GistPad` tab (the one with the little notebook icon). From this tree view, you can add/edit/delete/rename new pages, upload local files, as well as view the backlinks for each page (they appear as child notes of a page).\n\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/87234704-83a7c400-c388-11ea-90a8-2a660bef4dc5.png\" />\n\n## Editing your workspace\n\nWhen you create or open a page, you can edit the markdown content as usual, as well as [paste images](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#pasting-images-1), and create [`[[links]]` to other pages](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#links). When you type `[[`, you'll recieve auto-completion for the existing pages in your workspace, and you can also automatically create new pages by simply creating a link to it.\n\nSince you're using the Visual Studio Code markdown editor, you can benefit from all of the rich language services (e.g. syntax highlighting, header collapsing), as well as the extension ecosystem (e.g. [Emojisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.emojisense)).\n\n## Navigating your workspace\n\nWhen editing a file, you can easily navigate `[[links]]` by hovering over them to see a preview of their contents and/or `cmd+clicking` on them in order to jump to the respective page. Furthermore, when you add a link to a page, a [backlink](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#backlinks) is automatically added to it.\n\nYou can view a page's backlinks using either of the following techniques:\n\n1. Expanding the file's node in the `Repositories` tree, since it's child nodes will represent backlinks. This makes it easy to browse your pages and their backlinks in a single hierachical view.\n\n1. Opening a file, and then viewing it's backlinks list at the bottom of the editor view. This makes it easy to read a page and then see its backlinks in a contextually rich way.\n\n## Daily Pages\n\nIn addition to creating arbitrary pages, you can use GistPad for journaling or capturing [daily notes](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#daily-pages). Simply click the calendar icon in the `Repositories` tree, which will open up the page that represents today. If the page doesn't already exist, then it will be created in the workspace before being opened.\n\n<img width=\"700px\"
